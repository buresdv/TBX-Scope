## The Lightweight TBX Reader
TBX Scope is a lightweight browser for the Termbase Exchange Format (TBX). It's written mostly in SwiftUI with a few sprinkles of Cocoa.

## Cool Benchmarks
TBX Scope can load the entire Microsoft Terminology collection (around 33,000 individual entries) within a second and display them all without breaking a sweat.
